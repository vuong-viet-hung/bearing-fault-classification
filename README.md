# HUST Bearing (Work in Progress)
## Introduction
This repository contains researches dedicated to classification of bearing fault based on vibarational signal's short-time Fourier transform (STFT), using deep neural network to identify the type of defect.
The project provides an intuitive CLI interface for proposed algorithms.
We prioritize presenting previous researches in a readable and reproducible manner over introducing a faithful implementation.

The team behind this work is [Mandevices Laboratory](https://www.facebook.com/mandeviceslaboratory) from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST). Learn more about our reseaches [here](#about-us).
